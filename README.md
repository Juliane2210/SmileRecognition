# SmileRecognition

This is an end-to-end deep learning computer vision project

First start by cloning the repo. 

You will then want unzip the images.zip file from the data subfolder and extract it right at the root of the data subfolder.


You should have the following subfolders:


data

   testing_images

   training_images

  test_results       <----- output of running the prediction.py



Before running the script enter the following command in the terminal : pip install -r requirements.txt

Run these scripts in the following order by typing in the terminal  : python <fileName.py>

1) separateData.py
2) loadData.py
3) predict.py  (to run this last file type : python predict.py `<file_path>`)

under data subfolder there is an images.zip file which needs to be extracted at the root of the data folder
